# WebRTC Client Web Demo

This folder is intentionally isolated for parallel WebRTC development.

## Milestone status
- Milestone 1: scaffold only (no production UI/RTC flow yet)
- Milestone 2: will implement full join room + audio calling demo

## Local run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Expected signaling backend URL for milestone 2: `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
